#Branch Predictor Simulator

Overview
This project implements a cycle-accurate branch predictor simulator that supports three prediction schemes:

+ Bimodal Predictor: Uses a 2-bit saturating counter
+ Gshare Predictor: Incorporates global branch history
+ Hybrid Predictor: Combines both predictors with a chooser mechanism
